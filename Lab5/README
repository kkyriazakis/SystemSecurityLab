ransomware.sh:
	This script is called with 2 argumens as below:
		./ransomware.sh path X
	If you want to create the files on current path, pass "./" in path parameter. 
	1.The tool creates the directory if it does not exist. Then, with LD_PRELOAD, calls test_aclog with -c (create) argument
	  so that it creates a specific file, the title of which is also an argument.
	2.Then the tool calls test_aclog with -e (encrypt) argument so that it encrypts the given file
	3.Deletes the original file

test_aclog.c:
	Depending on the input arguments, either creates or encrypts a file using fopen, fwrite.
	To encrypt the file, the encrypt function from assignment2 was used with some modifications.
